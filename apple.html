        <p>Drawing a Apple can be a rewarding experience, This tutorial will guide you through the process. Here's a step-by-step tutorial for drawing a simple, realistic Apple.</p>
    <!--start of the step by step on how to draw a face-->
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Materials You'll Need</h2></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pencil</li>
        <li>Eracer</li>
        <li>Paper</li>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Step 1: Draw the Basic Shapes</h3></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Draw the main outline of the apple: Start by sketching a simple oval or rounded shape for the apple. Use a light pencil to create a smooth curve at the top and a slightly wider base at the bottom</li>
                    <li>Add the stem and leaf: Sketch a short, slightly curved line for the stem on the top. Draw a leaf connected to the stem, curving outward.</li>
                </ol>

            <li><h3>Step 2: Define the Contours</h3></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Refine the apple's shape: Erase unnecessary guidelines and define the curves of the apple's body to make it look more natural.</li>
                    <li>Detail the leaf: Add veins to the leaf by drawing a central vein with smaller lines extending from it.</li>  
                </ol>

            <li><h3>Step 3: Light Shading</h3></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start shading the apple: Add light shading where the light does not hit the surface. Imagine the light source is coming from one side, and add soft shadows to the opposite side of the apple and under the leaf.</li>
                    <li>Add texture to the leaf: Shade the leaf with light pencil strokes, following the direction of the veins.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="images/step3 apple.png" alt="step3 picure" class="image">
            <li><h3>Step 4:Darker Shading</h3></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Increase contrast: Add more shading to areas that are farther from the light source, such as the bottom of the apple and the areas beneath the leaf and stem.</li>
                    <li>Highlight the shiny spots: Leave a small part of the apple unshaded to represent the areas that catch the light, making the apple look glossy.</li>
                </ol>

            <li><h3>Step 5: Depth and Texture</h3></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enhance the texture: Add subtle lines or curves on the apple's surface to give it a more realistic appearance. Make sure the shading is smooth and transitions from light to dark naturally.</li>
                    <li>Darken the edges: Deepen the shading around the edges to give the apple more volume and a three-dimensional look.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="images/step5 apple.png" alt="step5 picure" class="image">
            <li><h3>Step 6: Draw the Eyebrows</h3></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Smooth out the shading: Blend the shaded areas using a blending stump or tissue to smooth out harsh lines.</li>
                    <li>Add finishing details: Go over the leaf and stem, adding darker shading to enhance the overall contrast and realism.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="images/step6 apple.png" alt="step6 picure" class="image">

        <p>By following these steps, you'll be able to create a well-shaded and realistic apple drawing just like the one in the image!</p>
